                <p class="lead">Whos better? Russell Wesbrook or Stephen Curry</p>
                <p>It's virtually impossible to imagine a successful NBA team without great point guard play. Point guards are often the extension of a coach, responsible for enhancing the play of others offensively while also setting the tone defensively.</p>
                <p>So, who's the best point guard in today's NBA: Stephen Curry? Chris Paul? Russell Westbrook? There's no easy answer and we all have a preference. But the question isn't who do we prefer, it's who's the best.
Many factors -- from clutch play to leadership and beyond -- come into play in this debate. Perhaps a legendary point guard (who himself was once in a "best point guard" debate in his day) can solve the issue? NBA TV analyst, Hall of Famer and legendary Detroit Pistons point guard Isiah Thomas explains the best point guard thusly:
"First thing you have to be able to do is take the game plan out of the coach's hand and execute it out on the floor. Do you have voice? If you don't have a voice then you can't lead the team," Thomas said. "Skill wise, you have to be able to score. If you can't score the basketball then you're a liability on the floor because your passing lanes are closed.
"You also have to be able to make all the passes. Bounce pass, chest pass, over the head pass, pass off the dribble, pass with touch and pass with timing. At the end of a game you have to be a decent foul shooter because the ball is going to be in your hands. Defensively, unlike a big man, you find yourself in every situation. You're getting posted up, you have to guard pick and roll, you have to guard one-on-one and mid-range. Therefore, you have to guard 94 feet."</p>

                        I think this question has an obvious answer: Steph Curry.

But, let me first speak about Russell Westbrook. Westbrook is an elite basketball player, a superstar. He is not your pass first point guard and he is definitely not your average competitor. Westbrook's biggest asset and biggest weakness is his competitive drive. He wants to win and will do whatever it takes. He throws his body in harm's way and paces up and down the floor like a mad man. However, he lacks the shooting ability from distance that a Steph Curry possesses or even his teammate Kevin Durant possesses.

Steph Curry is the better basketball player today and will be the better basketball player in 7-10 years as well (pending some catastrophic injury like an ACL or his troublesome ankles). Steph is a below the basket player and does not jump out of the stadium like Westbrook. This will give him a longer career. Look at Kobe Bryant (yes, I know I always talk about Kobe), he is arguably one of the top 10 players in NBA history. But Kobe had an above the rim game which has made him struggle later in his career, especially this year. Yet, even he wasn't as flashy as Russell is at his smaller stature. Steph can shoot the ball brilliantly and is truly a dominant force. He also makes his teammates better.

                        Russell Westbrook by far, no comparison.

Steph Curry is an elite shooter. Probably the most efficient behind the arc specialist to have ever played the game. Had the question inquired who is the better shooter between the two. Then Steph Curry by far. But its not. The question is about who is the better overall player.
